# Email Spam Detection

Introduction :
Email spam detection system is used to detect email spam using Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Processing and Python, where we have a dataset contain a lot of emails by extract important words and then use naive classifier we can detect if this email is spam or not.

# Prerequisites
This is list of required packages and modules for the project to be installed :

Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Install all required packages :

 pip install -r requirements.txt

# The Dataset
Human activites dataset contain about 5730 record which is a sample of an email and a target column "spam" which describe the state of an email spam or not.

# Coding Sections
In this part we will see the project code divided to sections as follows:

Section 1 | The Data :
In this section we aim to do some operations on the dataset before training the model on it, processes like :

Data Loading : Load the dataset
Data Visualization : Visualize dataset features
Data Cleaning : Remove stopwords and duplicates values
Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Section 2 | The Model :
The dataset is ready for training, so we create a naive classifier using scikit-learn and thin fit it to the data, and finally we evaluate the model by getting accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix
